#Long March Engine Project (Engine2021)

C++ 20 <br/>
OpenGL 4.5 <br/>
VS2019 16.8 <br/>
Win10 x64 <br/>

##Startup

The project contains source of the engine, and source sample applications.

1. Use `git lfs pull` to download zipped large files.

2. Run `./unzip-assets.bat` in the root folder to unzip large files.

3. In each sample project, run `generate-project.bat` script to generate a MSCV solution for the application.

4. To create your own application, please follow the same folder structure(or change path settings in application/engine-config.json for each project). 

Optional: <br/>
Run index.html under engine/external/Remotery/vis/ for profiling. Beware that it may block other profiling tools such as Nvidia Nsight.
